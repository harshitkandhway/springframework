ERROR 1) unresolvable circular reference

When we have two different classes defined in such a manner that one class is using other class reference and vice-versa
and are also having a parameterized constructor to set the values in their refference respectively.
When spring tries to create the bean of the class it will get this error as it will go to class A constructor then it
will find B in the constructor and so it will try to create the bean of B first and so on.

Example:
@Component
public class A {
    private B b;

    public A(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

@Component
public class B {
    private A a;

    public B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ApplicationContext injector = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext("springframework.day1.circulardependency");
        A a = injector.getBean(A.class);
    }
}

On running the Main method in Client we will get the above mentioned BeanCurrentlyInCreationException
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException: Error creating bean with name 'a':
Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?
